         <h4>NO 1 :: </h4>

        <h3>Creating Button of Calculator</h3>
        As you might have already guessed, we would need to create “buttons” for inputting values and a screen for displaying these values.
Well, basically, that’s it!
But in fancier terms, these are the components we need:
· A display area for displaying operators, operands and solutions.
· Buttons for inputting values to the display screen
Visually, a calculator is a table enclosed in a container. And as you should already know tables are made of rows and columns with cells to contain table data.

        <h4>Link Pages Using a Tag</h4>
         The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

            The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. <br>
            By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: <br>
            An unvisited link is underlined and blue <br>
            A visited link is underlined and purple<br>
            An active link is underlined and red <br>
